Easily and pragmatically control my own instruments with Python

nice to meet you.
I am interested in remotely controlling radio instruments and using them for simple and practical tasks.
I use the Python language, and I hope everyone can easily edit it for personal use by referencing the source code.
I hope you will also be interested in helping this project develop further.
