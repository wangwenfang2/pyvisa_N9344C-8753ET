Easily and pragmatically control my own instruments with Python

nice to meet you.
I am interested in remotely controlling radio instruments and using them for simple and practical tasks.
I use the Python language, and I hope everyone can easily edit it for personal use by referencing the source code.
Please help us to make this project even better!
